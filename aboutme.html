				<h1>Ravi Teja Gajarla</h1>			
				<p>I completed my under graduation in 2015 and since then I worked as a Software Engineer. I have knowledge in Java, JavaScript, MuleSoft and its related technologies in the systems integration domain. 
				<p>As a MuleSoft Developer I predominantly developed APIs and micro services for different retail gaints based out in the UK and Europe. I have also worked onsite in the UK for more than half year before coming to Pace.
				<p>I'm looking forward to get Master's Degree in Computer Science then go back and work as a MuleSoft developer.</p>
				<p>I would like give tell about some of my hobbies here. Following are the things I do whenever I get time.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>I like to watch movies and online TV series in Netflix </li>
						<li>I like to play puzzles and frequently I solve sudoku every now and then and while travelling.</li>
					</ul>
					As a software developer I always wanted to develop a sudoku game and work on develop different kinds of puzzles for different age groups and pulish them. I didn't get time to start working them and didn't dedicate myself to it. But I'll definitely do it at some point of the time in the near future.</p>
				<p>If you would like to try sudoku now, here is the link <a target="_blank" href="https://sudoku.game/"><span>Sudoku</span></a></p>
				<p>And here is the link to Netflix where you can watch different kinds of movies and TV series <a target="_blank" href="https://netflix.com/"><span>Netflix</span></a></p>
				<p>I also like to go on a tour once a year and went to Scotland last year when I was in the UK. Here are some pictures that I shot from my mobile in that trip.</p>
